  Scenario: Content Items are cached based on users permissions
    Given I am viewing the pages on siteaccess "site" as "admin" with password "publish"
    And I visit "Users/Administrator-users/Administrator-User" on siteaccess "site"
    And I reload the page
    And I should see "Administrator User"
    And response headers contain
      | Header          | Value                                                         |
      | Cache-Control   | public, s-maxage=86400                                        |
      | X-Symfony-Cache | GET /site/Users/Administrator-users/Administrator-User: fresh |
    When I am viewing the pages on siteaccess "site" as "Anonymous"
    And I visit "Users/Administrator-users/Administrator-User" on siteaccess "site"
